# ./timber: error while loading shared libraries: libsfml-graphics.so.2.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I found that:
* if I use `-L~/path/to/sfml`, it will work fine
* if I use `-L/home/username/path/to/sfml`, it will show this error.

Finally, I modify my export code:
```
export SFML_LIB_PATH='~/path/to/sfml'
```

And the problem is fixed. Just mark it.
